# Portfolio

This is my portfolio built with [`sveltekit`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) and hosted on [`vercel`](https://vercel.com/).

## Prerequisites

I love using the [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) package manager, so I recommend using that. If you don't want to use `pnpm`, you can use `npm` or `yarn` instead.

```bash
# install the package manager
npm install -g pnpm

# install dependencies
pnpm install
```

## Developing

Once you've created the project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `npm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server exposed to the network
pnpm dev --host
```

## Building

To create a production version of this app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`
